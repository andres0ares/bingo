## Hi there! this my new project


The objective of this project was to learn how to use web sockets and how to create a multiplayer game. It was created using Next.js, React and Sockets.io. You can check it out  for the English version. Feel free to modify as you wish.

If you want the logic of the game bingo, go to utils â†’ bingo.js.



## Getting Started

Install node.js 16  version  v16.20.2 combatiable with our application
        npm 8.19.4  version 
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
to run in background
nohup npm run dev &

```
Docker Container application 

docker build -t imagename rootdir


docker build -t bingo .

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name bingo your-image-name



docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name bingoapp bingo


# Build and start the Docker container
docker-compose up -d

To stop the containers, you can use the following command:
# Stop the Docker containers

docker-compose down

# Restart the Docker after permissions Granted

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

sudo usermod -aG jenkins $USER

sudo systemctl restart docker

docker-compose build

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Example

You can create a room where multiplayers can join to participate:
